<p>I'm a DPhil student in computer science at Oxford University, where I work on algorithmic verification with James Worrell (link), and Joel Ouaknine. Previously I studied math at IISc Bangalore.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p class="notop">I'm currently thinking about discrete linear dynamical systems with perturbations. For example, see this blog post 
  about the <a href="https://justunreadableicon.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/on-the-2d-rotation-rounding-problem">2D Rotation Rounding Problem</a>.</p>

  <h3>Writing</h3> 
  <p class="notop">I edited Resistance; Tales from a Post-Antibiotic World, an anthology of short fiction themed around antibiotic resistance. 
  While microbiologists and other scientists have been warning about the dangers of drug-resistant bacteria for years, as far as I know there haven't been 
  significant reductions in the amount of antibiotics given to livestock, which is a major cause of resistance, and relatively easily reduced. 
  You can <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Resistance-Tales-Post-Antibiotic-Julian-DCosta/dp/8192570789/">buy it</a> on Amazon</p> 
  
  <p>Gaurang Sriraman and I had some fun messing around with Wasserstein training to build robust 
    image classifiers. (<a href="/files/Deep_Learning_project_adversarial_examples_Julian_Gaurang.pdf">pdf link</a>)</p>
